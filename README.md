## ✨ Features implemented

* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Session-based login system preventing unauthorized access to internal pages.
* **📚 Live Course Catalog:** Displays course details (Instructor, Credits) and **real-time seat availability**.
* **✅ Transactional Enrollment:**
    * Prevents over-enrollment (students cannot join if seats are 0).
    * **Concurrency Safety:** Uses `synchronized` methods to ensure seat counts are accurate even if multiple students click "Enroll" simultaneously.
* **📅 Personal Timetable:** Automatically generates a weekly schedule based on enrolled courses.
* **📊 Grade Portal:** Students can view their academic history and letter grades.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Fully responsive UI using **Bootstrap 5**, accessible on mobile and desktop.
* **💾 XML Persistence:** Custom **DAO (Data Access Object)** layer using **JAXB** to store all data in local XML files (No SQL database required).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer.
* Apache Tomcat 10 or 11.
* IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended) or Eclipse.

### 2. Database Setup (Crucial Step)
This project reads data from a specific folder on your hard drive.

1.  Create a folder named `CourseData` in your `D:` drive (e.g., `D:/CourseData/`).
    * *Note: If you are on Mac/Linux or want to use C:, update the path in `StudentDAO.java`, `CourseDAO.java`, and `GradeDAO.java`.*
2.  Create three files inside that folder: `students.xml`, `courses.xml`, and `grades.xml`.
3.  Paste the initial XML data (provided in the source code or report) into these files.

### 3. IDE Configuration
1.  **Open** the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2.  **Load Maven Changes** (Right-click `pom.xml` -> Maven -> Reload Project).
3.  **Configure Tomcat:**
    * Click `Add Configuration` -> `Tomcat Server` -> `Local`.
    * In the **Deployment** tab, add the artifact: `CourseRegistrationSystem:war exploded`.
4.  **Run** the server.
